1) pdo.php: MySQL connection file. Please make changes to the password, username and database name accordingly. Table name used is Employees and dbname used is: user_profile.
2) index.php: Index page of the login web application.
3) login.php: Login page of the web application.
4) functions.js: Contains all the functions required in the pages. The problem is in runFacialRecognition() function used in login.php. I have hard coded the reference image name as of now. It will be changed once this works for atleast one image.
