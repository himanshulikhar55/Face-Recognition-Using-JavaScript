Please run the following command before running the application on localhost:
"npm install bootstrap@4.0.0 --save"
"npm install jquery@3.3.1 popper.js@1.12.9 --save"
Thank you.
I have just made a basic application and will be adding the MySQL server authentication next. Then I will add the image processing part for facial recognition.
